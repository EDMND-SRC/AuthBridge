## Team Retrospective Discussion

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🔄 TEAM RETROSPECTIVE - Epic 3: Case Management Dashboard
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Alright team, everyone's here. Let me set the stage for our retrospective."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Here's what we accomplished together."

**EPIC 3 SUMMARY:**

- Success criteria: Complete case management workflow
- Stakeholder feedback: Pending demo

**Alice (Product Owner):** "100% completion again! That's three epics in a row with perfect delivery."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The frontend stack upgrade was the biggest challenge - React 19.2, Mantine 8.3, Vite 7.3, TanStack Query v5 all in one epic. But we did it."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "500+ tests passing. The E2E test suite with Playwright is comprehensive - we have real confidence in the UI now."

**Winston (Architect):** "The SQS-based webhook delivery pattern from Epic 2 scaled perfectly to the approve/reject workflow. Good architecture pays dividends."


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**NEXT EPIC PREVIEW:** Epic 4: REST API & Webhooks
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Dependencies on Epic 3:**
- ✅ Case management UI patterns (reusable components)
- ✅ Webhook delivery infrastructure (SQS + retry logic)
- ✅ Audit logging patterns (immutable trail)
- ✅ API client with retry logic (exponential backoff)

**Preparation Needed:**
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Rate limiting implementation
- API key management system
- Developer portal for API keys
- Webhook signature verification

**Technical Prerequisites:**
- All Epic 3 stories deployed and tested ✅
- Webhook infrastructure proven in production
- Authentication patterns established
- Error handling standardized

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "And here's what's coming next. Epic 4 builds on the API patterns we established."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Epic 4 is where external developers can integrate AuthBridge. This opens up the platform to third-party applications."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The webhook infrastructure from Story 3.3 is exactly what Epic 4 needs. We've already proven the pattern."

**Winston (Architect):** "My concern is rate limiting. We need to implement proper throttling before exposing public APIs."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And we'll need API contract tests. The E2E patterns from Epic 3 will help, but API testing is different."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Team assembled for this retrospective:"

- Edmond (Project Lead) - Overall project direction
- Alice (Product Owner) - Product requirements and priorities
- Charlie (Senior Dev) - Frontend implementation lead
- Dana (QA Engineer) - Testing and quality assurance
- Winston (Architect) - Architecture and AWS infrastructure
- Bob (Scrum Master) - Facilitating this retrospective

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, you're joining us as Project Lead. Your perspective is crucial here."

**Edmond (Project Lead):** [Participating in the retrospective]

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Our focus today:"

1. Learning from Epic 3 execution
2. Preparing for Epic 4 success

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Ground rules: psychological safety first. No blame, no judgment. We focus on systems and processes, not individuals."

## What Went Well

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's start with the good stuff. What went well in Epic 3?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I'll start. The frontend stack upgrade was ambitious - React 19.2, Mantine 8.3, Vite 7.3, TanStack Query v5 - and we pulled it off in Story 3.1. That set the foundation for everything else."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The React Compiler is a game-changer. Automatic memoization means we don't have to think about useMemo/useCallback anymore. Performance is excellent out of the box."

**Winston (Architect):** "From my side, the component architecture is clean. The features/cases/ folder structure with hooks, components, types, and pages is exactly what we need for maintainability."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "The E2E test suite is comprehensive. 50+ Playwright tests covering all user flows. The auth fixture pattern from TD-008 made testing authenticated flows trivial."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "And the optimistic UI updates in Stories 3.3-3.5 make the app feel instant. Users see changes immediately, even before the API responds."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what stood out to you as going well in this epic?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "The code review process was excellent. Every story had thorough reviews with specific fixes - HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW severity categorization made prioritization clear. The team caught real issues before they shipped."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree. The bulk actions in Story 3.5 are sophisticated - partial success handling, individual audit entries, webhook notifications for each case. That's production-quality work."

**Winston (Architect):** "The immutable notes pattern in Story 3.4 is exactly right for compliance. Notes can never be edited or deleted - that's audit trail gold."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "One more thing - the accessibility testing with axe-core caught real issues. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance isn't just a checkbox, it's built into our E2E tests."


**Key Successes:**
- ✅ Frontend stack upgrade completed (React 19.2, Mantine 8.3, Vite 7.3, TanStack Query v5)
- ✅ React Compiler enabled for automatic optimization
- ✅ Clean component architecture (features/cases/ structure)
- ✅ Comprehensive E2E test suite (50+ Playwright tests)
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- ✅ Thorough code review process with severity categorization
- ✅ Bulk operations with partial success handling
- ✅ Immutable notes for audit compliance
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ SQS webhook delivery pattern reused successfully
- ✅ 100% story completion rate (5/5)

## Challenges & Issues

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Now let's talk about challenges. Where did we struggle?"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "The Mantine 8 API changes were painful. Table.ScrollContainer wrapper, Select data prop changes, DatePicker import changes - every component had breaking changes."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "That's fair. The upgrade guide helped, but we still had to fix dozens of components. Story 3.1 took longer than expected because of this."

**Winston (Architect):** "We should have done a spike first to understand the breaking changes before committing to the upgrade."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's your take on the Mantine upgrade challenge?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "It was the right call to upgrade - Mantine 8 has better performance and accessibility. But we could have planned better. A half-day spike would have identified the breaking changes upfront."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "From a product perspective, the upgrade didn't delay delivery. Story 3.1 absorbed the upgrade work, and subsequent stories went smoothly."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Another pattern I noticed - the E2E tests required careful selector management. Mantine components don't always have predictable selectors."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Yeah, we added data-testid attributes to everything. That's the right pattern, but it's extra work."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The auth fixture was tricky too. We had to mock Cognito authentication for E2E tests. The pattern works now, but it took iteration."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, did you notice any other challenges during the epic?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "The webhook delivery in Story 3.3 initially had a TODO for SQS integration. The code review caught it, and we fixed it. But it shows we need to be careful about TODOs in production code."

**Key Challenges:**
- Mantine 8 breaking changes required extensive component updates
- E2E selector management needed data-testid attributes throughout
- Auth fixture for Playwright required Cognito mocking
- TODO comments in production code (caught in review)
- No spike before major dependency upgrade

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's check our commitments from Epic 2's retrospective."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 1: Create central AWS Quotas documentation. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Winston (Architect):** "Done! docs/aws-quotas.md documents all service quotas for af-south-1."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 2: Create accessibility acceptance criteria template. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Done! docs/accessibility-criteria-template.md is now used for all UI stories."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 3: Update main README with integration test setup. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Done! Main README now points to test setup documentation."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 4: Implement user authentication (AWS Cognito). Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Done in the prep sprint before Epic 3. Cognito User Pool deployed, auth handlers working."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 5: Complete deployment runbook. Status: ⏳ IN PROGRESS"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Partially done. We have staging deployment documented, but production runbook needs work."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 6: Add load testing for API endpoints. Status: ❌ NOT ADDRESSED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Still on the backlog. We prioritized E2E tests for Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, looking at what we committed to - what's your reaction?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We completed 4 out of 6 action items, which is good. The deployment runbook and load testing are important for production readiness. Let's prioritize them before Epic 5."

## Next Epic Preparation Discussion

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Now let's shift gears. Epic 4 is coming up: 'REST API & Webhooks'"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "The question is: are we ready? What do we need to prepare?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "From my perspective, Epic 3 established the webhook infrastructure. Epic 4 extends it to external developers."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "I'm confident about the API implementation. We have patterns from Epic 3. But rate limiting is new territory."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And I need API contract testing tools. Playwright API fixtures will help, but we need proper OpenAPI validation."

**Winston (Architect):** "Rate limiting is critical. We can't expose public APIs without throttling. I recommend API Gateway throttling + Lambda concurrency limits."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's your sense of our readiness?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We're 85% ready. The webhook infrastructure is proven. The gaps are: (1) rate limiting implementation, (2) API documentation (OpenAPI), and (3) API key management. These can be addressed in Story 4.1."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree. Story 4.1 is about API authentication - that's where rate limiting and API keys belong."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Here's what I think we need technically before Epic 4 can start..."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "1. API Gateway throttling configuration - estimated 0.5 days"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "2. OpenAPI spec for existing endpoints - estimated 1 day"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "3. API key generation and storage - estimated 1 day"

**Winston (Architect):** "That's 2.5 days of prep work. But it can happen during Story 4.1."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "So no blocking prep work before Epic 4?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Correct. Story 4.1 (API Authentication) naturally includes rate limiting and API key management. We can start Epic 4 immediately."

**PREPARATION SUMMARY:**

**CRITICAL PREPARATION (Must complete before epic starts):**
- None - Epic 4 can start immediately

## Retrospective Closure

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "We've covered a lot of ground today. Let me bring this retrospective to a close."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ RETROSPECTIVE COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Epic 3: Case Management Dashboard - REVIEWED"

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Frontend stack upgrades require spikes** - The Mantine 8 breaking changes caught us off guard. Future major upgrades should include a half-day spike to identify breaking changes.

2. **E2E testing patterns are established** - The auth fixture, data-testid attributes, and Playwright patterns are now standard. Future UI epics will benefit.

3. **Optimistic UI updates improve UX** - Users see instant feedback. This pattern should be standard for all state-changing operations.

4. **Code review process is effective** - Severity categorization (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) helps prioritize fixes. Continue this practice.

5. **Webhook infrastructure is reusable** - The SQS-based delivery pattern from Epic 2 scaled to Epic 3. Epic 4 will reuse it again.

**Commitments made today:**
- Action Items: 5
- Preparation Tasks: 2
- Critical Path Items: 0

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Commitments made today:"

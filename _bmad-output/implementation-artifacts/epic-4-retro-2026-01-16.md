**Dana (QA Engineer):** "700+ tests passing. The integration test suite covers all API flows including retry logic and signature verification."

**Winston (Architect):** "The Lambda authorizer with caching is exactly right. 5-minute cache means we're not hitting DynamoDB on every request."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**NEXT EPIC PREVIEW:** Epic 5: Security & Compliance Foundation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Dependencies on Epic 4:**
- ✅ API authentication patterns (API keys, JWT)
- ✅ Audit logging infrastructure
- ✅ Rate limiting implementation
- ✅ Structured error responses

**Preparation Needed:**
- KMS key setup for attribute-level encryption

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "And here's what's coming next. Epic 5 is about security and compliance."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Epic 5 is critical for Data Protection Act 2024 compliance. We need encryption, audit trails, and data subject rights."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The audit logging from Epic 4 is a good foundation. We just need to extend it for compliance requirements."

**Winston (Architect):** "My concern is KMS key management. We need to set up proper key rotation and access policies."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And we'll need security testing. Penetration testing before production launch."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## What Went Well

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's start with the good stuff. What went well in Epic 4?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I'll start. The API documentation is excellent. The OpenAPI spec is comprehensive with examples for every endpoint. Developers will love it."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The code review process caught real issues. Story 4.1 had 8 fixes including the API key format prefix. Story 4.2 had 9 fixes including rate limit headers. Every review improved the code."

**Winston (Architect):** "From my side, the Lambda authorizer architecture is clean. 5-minute caching reduces DynamoDB load significantly. The API Gateway throttling at 50 RPS is exactly what we need."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "The integration tests are comprehensive. We have tests for retry logic, signature verification, rate limiting, and all error scenarios. 700+ tests give us real confidence."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "And the webhook infrastructure is production-ready. HMAC signatures, exponential backoff, delivery logging - it's enterprise-grade."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what stood out to you as going well in this epic?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "The velocity was impressive. 5 stories in ~1.5 sprints. The patterns from Epic 3 accelerated development significantly. We're building on solid foundations."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree. The API authentication guide in docs/api-authentication-guide.md is developer-friendly. Code examples in Node.js, Python, and PHP."

**Winston (Architect):** "The PII masking in Story 4.4 is exactly right for compliance. Omang numbers show last 4 digits only. Addresses show district only."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "One more thing - the structured error responses are consistent across all endpoints. Error codes, messages, details, and meta fields. Developers know what to expect."

**Key Successes:**
- ✅ Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with examples
- ✅ Thorough code review process (8-9 fixes per story)
- ✅ Lambda authorizer with 5-minute caching
- ✅ API Gateway throttling (50 RPS, 100 burst)
- ✅ 700+ tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Enterprise-grade webhook infrastructure (HMAC, retry, logging)
- ✅ Developer-friendly API authentication guide
- ✅ PII masking for compliance
- ✅ Consistent structured error responses
- ✅ 100% story completion rate (5/5)

## Challenges & Issues

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Now let's talk about challenges. Where did we struggle?"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The DynamoDB Scan for API key validation is a concern. When validating an API key, we scan all keys to find a match. That's O(n) and won't scale."

**Winston (Architect):** "That's a valid concern. We need a GSI on the hashed API key for O(1) lookup. I added a TODO in the code."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's your take on the DynamoDB Scan issue?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "It's technical debt we need to address. For MVP with a few clients, it's fine. But before scaling, we need that GSI. Let's add it to Epic 5 or a prep sprint."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "The integration tests for webhooks were tricky. We needed a mock webhook server to test delivery and retry logic. The pattern works now, but it took iteration."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The multipart form data parsing in Story 4.3 was more complex than expected. Binary data handling in Lambda requires careful buffer management."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Any other challenges during the epic?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "The session token expiry change from 24 hours to 30 minutes in Story 4.2 was a security improvement, but it required updating the SDK documentation."

**Winston (Architect):** "The API key format with environment prefix (`ab_live_`, `ab_test_`) was caught in code review. Good that we standardized it early."

**Key Challenges:**
- DynamoDB Scan for API key validation (needs GSI for scale)
- Mock webhook server setup for integration tests
- Multipart form data parsing complexity
- Session token expiry documentation update
- API key format standardization (caught in review)

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's check our commitments from Epic 3's retrospective."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 1: Create dependency upgrade spike template. Status: ⏳ IN PROGRESS"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Started but not complete. We haven't had a major upgrade since Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 2: Add data-testid to component library standards. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Done! All new components include data-testid attributes."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 3: Establish TODO comment policy. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Done! docs/todo-comment-policy.md requires linked GitHub issues for all TODOs."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 4: Complete deployment runbook. Status: ⏳ IN PROGRESS"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Partially done. Staging deployment documented, production runbook still needs work."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 5: Add load testing for API endpoints. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Done! scripts/load-tests/ has k6 scripts for all API endpoints. docs/load-testing-guide.md documents the process."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, looking at what we committed to - what's your reaction?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We completed 3 out of 5 action items. The deployment runbook is critical for production. Let's prioritize it before Epic 5 production deployment."

## Next Epic Preparation Discussion

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Now let's shift gears. Epic 5 is coming up: 'Security & Compliance Foundation'"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "The question is: are we ready? What do we need to prepare?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "From my perspective, Epic 4 established the audit logging patterns. Epic 5 extends them for compliance."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "I'm confident about the encryption implementation. AWS KMS is well-documented. But we need to design the data export/deletion workflow."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And I need security testing tools. We should do penetration testing before production."

**Winston (Architect):** "KMS key management is critical. We need proper key rotation policies and IAM access controls."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's your sense of our readiness?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We're 80% ready. The gaps are: (1) KMS key setup, (2) data export/deletion workflow design, (3) Casbin RBAC policy definitions. These can be addressed in Story 5.1."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree. Story 5.1 is about data encryption - that's where KMS setup belongs."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Here's what I think we need technically before Epic 5 can start..."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "1. KMS key creation and IAM policies - estimated 0.5 days"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "2. Data export/deletion workflow design - estimated 0.5 days"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "3. Casbin RBAC policy definitions - estimated 0.5 days"

**Winston (Architect):** "That's 1.5 days of prep work. But it can happen during Story 5.1."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "So no blocking prep work before Epic 5?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Correct. Story 5.1 (Data Encryption) naturally includes KMS setup. We can start Epic 5 immediately."

**PREPARATION SUMMARY:**

**CRITICAL PREPARATION (Must complete before epic starts):**
- None - Epic 5 can start immediately

**PARALLEL PREPARATION (Can happen during early stories):**
- [ ] KMS key creation and IAM policies
  - Owner: Winston (Architect)

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Those numbers tell a good story. 75% completion with one story at 97% is solid progress."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "I'm impressed we integrated two AWS services (Textract and Rekognition) without major issues."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "431 tests passing - that's 56 more tests than Epic 1.5. And 97.3% pass rate is excellent."

**Winston (Architect):** "The staging deployment in af-south-1 is a big milestone. We're actually running in production AWS now."



═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**NEXT EPIC PREVIEW:** Epic 3: Case Management Dashboard
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Dependencies on Epic 2:**
- ✅ Verification cases with OCR data (Story 2.1)
- ✅ Validation results for filtering (Story 2.2)
- ✅ Biometric scores for display (Story 2.3)
- ⏳ Duplicate detection flags (Story 2.4 - 97% complete)

**Preparation Needed:**
- React 19.2 + Mantine 8.3 frontend setup
- Authentication flow for Backoffice users
- Case list API endpoint with filtering
- Document viewer component for images
- Approve/reject workflow implementation

**Technical Prerequisites:**
- All Epic 2 stories deployed and tested
- DynamoDB queries optimized for case listing
- S3 presigned URLs for document viewing
- IAM permissions for Backoffice users

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "And here's what's coming next. Epic 3 builds on the verification pipeline we just built."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Epic 3 is where compliance officers finally get to see and act on verification cases. This is the user-facing payoff for all the backend work."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The dependencies look good. Epic 2 provides everything Epic 3 needs - case data, documents, scores, and flags."

**Winston (Architect):** "My concern is the frontend stack. We've been backend-focused for two epics. Epic 3 is our first React epic."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And we'll need E2E tests for the UI. Unit tests won't be enough for Epic 3."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Team assembled for this retrospective:"

- Edmond (Project Lead) - Overall project direction
- Alice (Product Owner) - Product requirements and priorities
- Charlie (Senior Dev) - Backend implementation lead
- Dana (QA Engineer) - Testing and quality assurance
- Winston (Architect) - Architecture and AWS infrastructure
- Bob (Scrum Master) - Facilitating this retrospective

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, you're joining us as Project Lead. Your perspective is crucial here."

**Edmond (Project Lead):** [Participating in the retrospective]

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Our focus today:"

1. Learning from Epic 2 execution
2. Preparing for Epic 3 success

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Ground rules: psychological safety first. No blame, no judgment. We focus on systems and processes, not individuals. Everyone's voice matters. Specific examples are better than generalizations."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "And everything shared here stays in this room - unless we decide together to escalate something."

## What Went Well

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's start with the good stuff. What went well in Epic 2?"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** *pauses, creating space*

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I'll start. The preparation sprint from Epic 1.5 retrospective paid off massively. The DynamoDB swap and integration test framework were ready when we needed them."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "I'll add to that - the SQS async processing pattern from Story 2.1 worked flawlessly. We used it again in Story 2.3 for biometrics, and it just worked. No surprises."

**Winston (Architect):** "From my side, the AWS service integrations (Textract and Rekognition) were smoother than expected. The af-south-1 region quotas were documented upfront, so no surprises there either."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Testing went incredibly well. The integration test framework from the prep sprint enabled us to test end-to-end flows. 431 tests passing gives me real confidence."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** *smiling* "And the pattern-based field extraction in Story 2.1 was elegant. Regex patterns for Omang fields worked better than position-based extraction."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what stood out to you as going well in this epic?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "The velocity was impressive - 3 stories completed with high quality, and Story 2.4 is 97% done. The weighted scoring approach in Story 2.3 (liveness 30%, similarity 70%) shows mature engineering thinking."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree with Edmond. The risk scoring algorithms (biometric, duplicate detection) are sophisticated but well-documented. That's production-quality work."

**Winston (Architect):** "And the privacy-preserving duplicate detection with SHA-256 hashing is exactly the right approach for Data Protection Act 2024 compliance."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "One more thing - the comprehensive dev notes in each story continued to be game-changers. Story 2.1 had 15+ pages of context, which made implementation so much faster."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Yeah, and the 'Previous Story Intelligence' sections helped us reuse patterns from earlier stories. We didn't reinvent the wheel."

---

## Challenges & Issues

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Okay, we've celebrated some real wins. Now let's talk about challenges - where did we struggle? What slowed us down?"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** *creates safe space with tone and pacing*

**Dana (QA Engineer):** *hesitates* "Well... the integration tests for Story 2.4 require DynamoDB Local on port 8000. That's not documented in the main README, so anyone running tests will hit failures."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "That's a valid concern. We have 12 integration tests that only pass if you have DynamoDB Local running. That's a setup burden."

**Winston (Architect):** *defensive* "Hold on - we documented it in `tests/integration/README.md`. The setup instructions are there."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** *frustrated* "But that's buried in a subfolder! The main README should mention it, or we should use mocks for integration tests."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** *intervening calmly* "Let's take a breath here. This is exactly the kind of thing we need to unpack."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Dana, you're concerned about test setup complexity. Winston, you're saying it's documented. Charlie, you're acknowledging the burden."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, you have visibility across the whole project. What's your take on this situation?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I think both perspectives are valid. Integration tests with real DynamoDB are valuable for confidence, but the setup barrier is real. Let's add a note to the main README pointing to the integration test setup guide, and consider adding a 'make test-integration' command that checks for DynamoDB Local first."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "So it sounds like the core issue is discoverability - the docs exist but aren't easy to find. Not any individual person's fault."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** *softening* "Yeah, that makes sense. If the main README points to integration test setup, I'm okay with it."

**Winston (Architect):** "I appreciate that. I could've been more proactive about surfacing the setup requirements."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "This is good. We're identifying systemic improvements, not assigning blame."



**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Speaking of patterns, I noticed something when reviewing all the story records..."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "AWS service quotas were a recurring concern - Textract 1 TPS in af-south-1, Rekognition 5 TPS. This showed up in Stories 2.1 and 2.3 dev notes."

**Winston (Architect):** "Oh wow, I didn't realize it was that widespread."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Yeah. And there's more - the async processing pattern (SQS) was chosen specifically to handle these quota limits. That's smart architecture."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The SQS pattern with reserved concurrency and batch size of 1 respects the quotas naturally. No custom throttling needed."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, did you notice these quota concerns during the epic?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I did. The quota research from the prep sprint was valuable. We knew the limits upfront and designed around them. That's proactive engineering."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Can we document these quota limits in a central place? Like an 'AWS Quotas' doc that all stories reference?"

**Winston (Architect):** "That's a great idea. I'll create that as an action item."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Another pattern I noticed - Story 2.4 is 97% complete but marked 'in-progress'. The integration tests require DynamoDB Local, which blocked final completion."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Yeah, that's frustrating. The code is done, tests are written, but we can't mark it 'done' until the integration tests pass."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "That's actually a good thing - it means we're holding ourselves to high standards. 'Done' means all tests passing, not just unit tests."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's your take on the 'done' criteria for Story 2.4?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I agree with Dana. If integration tests are part of our definition of 'done', then Story 2.4 isn't done until they pass. But we should make DynamoDB Local setup easier."

## Previous Retrospective Follow-Through

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Before we move on, I want to circle back to Epic 1.5's retrospective."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "We made some commitments in that retro. Let's see how we did."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 1: Create API endpoint checklist template. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Winston (Architect):** "We nailed that one! The checklist includes idempotency, rate limiting, error handling, audit logging, authentication, and authorization."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "And it helped! We used it for all Epic 2 endpoints and caught issues early."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 2: Define 'done' criteria (MVP vs. production). Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "Story templates now explicitly state MVP vs. production scope. No more confusion like we had in Epic 1.5."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 3: Create accessibility acceptance criteria template. Status: ❌ NOT ADDRESSED"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "We... didn't do that one. Epic 2 is backend-only, so accessibility wasn't relevant. But we still need it for Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 4: Swap in-memory storage for DynamoDB in auth service. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "This was done in the prep sprint. Auth service now uses real DynamoDB. No more in-memory storage."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 5: Create integration test framework. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "This was also done in the prep sprint. We have 12 integration test scenarios for Epic 2. Huge win."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 6: Document async processing pattern decision. Status: ✅ COMPLETED"

**Winston (Architect):** "SQS pattern documented in architecture doc. Rationale: handles quotas naturally, built-in DLQ, easy migration to EventBridge later."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 7: Create deployment runbook. Status: ⏳ IN PROGRESS"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "We deployed to staging, but the runbook isn't complete. We need to document the full deployment process."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Action item 8: Add load testing for API endpoints. Status: ❌ NOT ADDRESSED"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Yeah, we haven't done load testing yet. That's still on the backlog."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, looking at what we committed to last time and what we actually did - what's your reaction?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We completed 6 out of 8 action items, which is excellent. The two we didn't complete (accessibility template and load testing) are both important, but they weren't blockers for Epic 2. Let's make sure we address them before Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Alright, we've covered a lot of ground. Let me summarize what I'm hearing..."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "**Successes:**"
- Preparation sprint from Epic 1.5 paid off (DynamoDB swap, integration tests)
- SQS async processing pattern worked flawlessly (reused in Stories 2.1 and 2.3)
- AWS service integrations smoother than expected (Textract, Rekognition)
- Pattern-based field extraction elegant and effective
- Weighted scoring algorithms sophisticated and well-documented
- Privacy-preserving duplicate detection with SHA-256 hashing
- 431 tests passing (97.3% pass rate) gives confidence
- Comprehensive dev notes accelerated development
- Staging deployment active in af-south-1

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "**Challenges:**"
- Integration test setup complexity (DynamoDB Local requirement)
- Documentation discoverability (setup guide buried in subfolder)
- Story 2.4 blocked on integration test setup (97% complete)
- AWS service quotas recurring concern (documented but needs central reference)
- Deployment runbook incomplete
- Load testing not yet done
- Accessibility template still not created (deferred from Epic 1.5)

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "**Key Insights:**"
- Preparation sprints are high-value investments (DynamoDB swap, integration tests)
- SQS async pattern handles AWS quotas naturally (no custom throttling)
- Integration tests with real AWS services provide confidence
- Weighted scoring algorithms enable nuanced decision-making
- Privacy-preserving techniques (SHA-256 hashing) enable compliance
- Documentation discoverability matters as much as documentation quality
- 'Done' means all tests passing, including integration tests

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Does that capture it? Anyone have something important we missed?"

**Winston (Architect):** "One more thing - the staging deployment in af-south-1 is a big milestone. We're no longer just local development. We're running in real AWS."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Agreed. And the endpoints are live: auth at https://zscpgvpyk9.execute-api.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/staging and verification at https://maybpud8y5.execute-api.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/staging."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "That's huge. We can now test against real infrastructure, not just mocks."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Good additions. Anything else?"

*Team members shake heads, indicating nothing major missed*

## Next Epic Preparation Discussion

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Now let's shift gears. Epic 3 is coming up: 'Case Management Dashboard'"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "The question is: are we ready? What do we need to prepare?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "From my perspective, we need to finish Story 2.4 before starting Epic 3. Duplicate detection flags are part of the case detail view."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** *concerned* "I'm worried about the frontend stack. We've been backend-focused for two epics. Epic 3 is React 19.2 + Mantine 8.3. That's a big context switch."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And I need E2E testing tools. Playwright or Cypress. Unit tests won't be enough for Epic 3."

**Winston (Architect):** "I'm less worried about frontend and more about authentication. Epic 3 needs Backoffice user login. We have API authentication, but not user authentication."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, the team is surfacing some real concerns here. What's your sense of our readiness?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I think we're 70% ready. The backend is solid, but we have four gaps: (1) finish Story 2.4, (2) frontend stack setup, (3) E2E testing tools, and (4) user authentication. Let's tackle those before Epic 3."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree with Edmond about Story 2.4, but I'm also worried about the frontend learning curve. None of us have used React 19.2 or Mantine 8.3 yet."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Here's what I think we need technically before Epic 3 can start..."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "1. Complete Story 2.4 (DynamoDB Local setup + integration tests) - estimated 0.5 days"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "2. Set up React 19.2 + Mantine 8.3 frontend project - estimated 1 day"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "3. Implement user authentication (AWS Cognito) - estimated 2 days"
**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "4. Set up E2E testing (Playwright) - estimated 1 day"

**Winston (Architect):** "That's like 4.5 days! That's almost a full sprint of prep work!"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Exactly. We can't just jump into Epic 3 on Monday."

**Alice (Product Owner):** *frustrated* "But we have stakeholder pressure to show the Backoffice UI. They're not going to be happy about another 'prep sprint.'"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Let's think about this differently. What happens if we DON'T do this prep work?"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "We'll hit blockers in the middle of Epic 3, velocity will tank, and we'll ship late anyway."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Worse - we'll build UI without authentication, and it'll be insecure. Or we'll skip E2E tests and ship buggy UI."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, you're balancing stakeholder pressure against technical reality. How do you want to handle this?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Let's find a middle ground. Story 2.4 completion and user authentication are non-negotiable - we need those before Epic 3. The frontend setup and E2E testing can happen during Epic 3 Story 3.1 planning. That keeps us moving without cutting corners."



**Alice (Product Owner):** "And can any of the critical prep happen in parallel with starting Epic 3?"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** *thinking* "Maybe. If we tackle Story 2.4 completion and user authentication before the epic starts, we could do frontend setup during Story 3.1."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "But that means Story 3.1 can't depend on having the full frontend stack ready upfront."

**Alice (Product Owner):** *looking at epic plan* "Actually, Story 3.1 is about case list view. We can start with basic React setup and add Mantine components as we go."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, the team is finding a workable compromise here. Does this approach make sense to you?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Yes. Let's do Story 2.4 completion and user authentication before Epic 3 (2.5 days), then start Epic 3 with Story 3.1 while doing frontend setup in parallel. That keeps us moving without cutting corners."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "I'm hearing a clear picture of what we need before Epic 3. Let me summarize..."

**CRITICAL PREPARATION (Must complete before epic starts):**
- [ ] Complete Story 2.4 (DynamoDB Local setup + integration tests)

## Significant Discovery Analysis

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, we need to flag something important."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "During Epic 2, the team uncovered findings that may require updating the plan for Epic 3."

**Significant Changes Identified:**

1. **User authentication not yet implemented**
   - Impact: Epic 3 assumes Backoffice users can log in, but authentication doesn't exist
   - Current state: Only API authentication (JWT tokens for SDK/API)
   - Recommendation: Implement AWS Cognito user authentication before Epic 3 (critical path)

2. **Frontend stack not yet set up**
   - Impact: Epic 3 is first React epic, but no frontend project exists
   - Current assumption: Frontend infrastructure ready
   - Recommendation: Set up React 19.2 + Mantine 8.3 during Story 3.1 (parallel work)

3. **E2E testing tools not available**
   - Impact: Epic 3 UI stories need E2E tests, but no tools configured
   - Current state: Only unit and integration tests for backend
   - Recommendation: Set up Playwright during Story 3.1 (parallel work)

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Yeah, when we realized user authentication was missing, it fundamentally changed our understanding of Epic 3's readiness."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "And from a product perspective, not having the frontend stack means Epic 3's first story will include setup work, not just feature work."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "If we start Epic 3 as-is, we're going to hit walls fast."

**Impact on Epic 3:**

The current plan for Epic 3 assumes:
- User authentication exists (login, roles, permissions)
- Frontend project is set up (React 19.2 + Mantine 8.3)
- E2E testing tools are configured (Playwright or Cypress)

But Epic 2 revealed:
- User authentication doesn't exist (only API authentication)
- Frontend project not yet created
- E2E testing tools not configured

This means Epic 3 likely needs:
- Story 3.1 to include frontend project setup
- User authentication implemented before epic starts
- E2E testing setup during Story 3.1
- Accessibility criteria added to all UI stories

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:**

1. Implement user authentication (AWS Cognito) before Epic 3 (critical path)
2. Update Story 3.1 to include frontend project setup
3. Set up E2E testing (Playwright) during Story 3.1
4. Add accessibility criteria to all Epic 3 story acceptance criteria

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "**Epic Update Required**: YES - Implement user authentication before Epic 3, update Story 3.1 scope"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, this is significant. We need to address this before committing to Epic 3's current plan. How do you want to handle it?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I agree these are real gaps. Let's implement user authentication before Epic 3 (critical path), and update Story 3.1 to include frontend setup. The E2E testing can happen in parallel with Story 3.1."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I agree with Edmond's approach. Better to adjust the plan now than fail mid-epic."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "This is why retrospectives matter. We caught this before it became a disaster."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Adding to critical path: Implement user authentication before Epic 3 kickoff."

## Critical Readiness Exploration

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Before we close, I want to do a final readiness check."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Epic 2 is marked 75% complete in sprint-status, but is it REALLY done?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "What do you mean, Bob?"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "I mean truly production-ready, stakeholders happy, no loose ends that'll bite us later."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, let's walk through this together."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, tell me about the testing for Epic 2. What verification has been done?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "We have 431 tests passing across all four stories. Test coverage is >85% for all services. We have integration tests for Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3. Story 2.4 integration tests are written but require DynamoDB Local setup."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "I can add to that - the integration tests give me confidence in end-to-end flows. OCR → Validation → Biometric → Duplicate Detection all tested. But honestly, Story 2.4 isn't fully validated until those integration tests pass."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, are you confident Epic 2 is production-ready from a quality perspective?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "For MVP and unblocking Epic 3, yes - the core verification pipeline works. For production with real customers, we need Story 2.4 integration tests passing and load testing done."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Okay, let's capture that. What specific testing is still needed?"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "I can handle Story 2.4 integration test validation, estimated 0.5 days. And load testing for all endpoints, estimated 1 day."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Adding to critical path: Complete Story 2.4 integration tests before Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, what's the deployment status for Epic 2? Is it live in production, scheduled for deployment, or still pending?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Deployed to staging in af-south-1. Auth service at https://zscpgvpyk9.execute-api.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/staging and verification service at https://maybpud8y5.execute-api.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/staging. Production deployment planned after Epic 3 completion."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "The staging deployment is working well. We've tested OCR, validation, and biometrics end-to-end. No issues."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, when is production deployment planned? Does that timing work for starting Epic 3?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Production deployment planned after Epic 3 completion. That timing works - we want the full verification + case management flow tested before going live."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, have stakeholders seen and accepted the Epic 2 deliverables?"

**Alice (Product Owner):** "This is important - I've seen 'done' epics get rejected by stakeholders and force rework."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, any feedback from stakeholders still pending?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Stakeholders haven't seen Epic 2 yet because it's backend processing. They'll see it when we demo the full verification flow with Backoffice UI after Epic 3. No acceptance risk here."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, this is a gut-check question: How does the codebase feel after Epic 2?"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Stable and maintainable? Or are there concerns lurking?"

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Be honest, Edmond. We've all shipped epics that felt... fragile."

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "The codebase feels very solid. The patterns are clean, the tests are comprehensive, and the architecture is sound. My only concern is the integration test setup complexity, but that's manageable."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, are there any unresolved blockers or technical issues from Epic 2 that we're carrying forward?"

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "Things that might create problems for Epic 3 if we don't deal with them?"

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Nothing is off limits here. If there's a problem, we need to know."

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Two blockers: (1) Story 2.4 integration tests need DynamoDB Local setup, and (2) user authentication doesn't exist yet. Both are captured and have owners."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Okay Edmond, let me synthesize what we just uncovered..."

**EPIC 2 READINESS ASSESSMENT:**

**Testing & Quality:** ✅ Excellent with one gap
- 431 tests passing, >85% coverage
- Integration tests for Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
- ⚠️ Action needed: Complete Story 2.4 integration tests (0.5 days)

**Deployment:** ✅ Staging active
- Deployed to af-south-1 staging environment
- Auth + Verification services live and tested
- Production deployment planned after Epic 3

**Stakeholder Acceptance:** ✅ Not applicable
- Backend processing, no stakeholder demo needed until Epic 3

**Technical Health:** ✅ Very stable
- Clean patterns, comprehensive tests, sound architecture
- ⚠️ Action needed: User authentication for Epic 3 (2 days)

**Unresolved Blockers:** ⚠️ Two blockers
- Story 2.4 integration tests (0.5 days)
- User authentication missing (2 days)

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, does this assessment match your understanding?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "Yes, that's accurate. Epic 2 is 75% complete from a story perspective, and we have 2.5 days of critical work before Epic 3."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Based on this assessment, Epic 2 is 75% complete from a story perspective, but we have 2 critical items before Epic 3."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "This level of thoroughness is why retrospectives are valuable."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Better to catch this now than three stories into the next epic."

## Retrospective Closure

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "We've covered a lot of ground today. Let me bring this retrospective to a close."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✅ RETROSPECTIVE COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Epic 2: Omang Document Processing - REVIEWED"

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Preparation sprints are high-value investments** - DynamoDB swap and integration test framework from Epic 1.5 prep sprint enabled Epic 2 success
2. **SQS async pattern handles AWS quotas naturally** - No custom throttling needed, built-in DLQ for reliability
3. **Integration tests with real AWS services provide confidence** - End-to-end validation catches issues unit tests miss
4. **Weighted scoring algorithms enable nuanced decision-making** - Biometric (liveness 30%, similarity 70%) and duplicate risk scoring (0-100 scale)
5. **Privacy-preserving techniques enable compliance** - SHA-256 hashing for duplicate detection meets Data Protection Act 2024
6. **Documentation discoverability matters** - Setup guides must be easy to find, not buried in subfolders
7. **Staging deployment is a major milestone** - Running in real AWS (af-south-1) enables realistic testing

**Alice (Product Owner):** "That first takeaway is huge - the prep sprint investment paid off 10x in Epic 2 velocity."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "And takeaway 2 is something we can apply to any AWS service with quotas. SQS is our go-to pattern now."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Commitments made today:"

- Action Items: 10
- Preparation Tasks: 4
- Critical Path Items: 2

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "That's a lot of commitments. We need to actually follow through this time."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Agreed. Which is why we'll review these action items in our next standup."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎯 NEXT STEPS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **Execute Preparation Sprint (Est: 2.5 days)**
   - Complete Story 2.4 integration tests
   - Implement user authentication (AWS Cognito)
   - Update main README with integration test setup

2. **Complete Critical Path items before Epic 3**
   - Story 2.4 integration tests passing
   - User authentication functional
   - Verify all action items are in progress

3. **Review action items in next standup**
   - Ensure ownership is clear
   - Track progress on commitments
   - Adjust timelines if needed

4. **Begin Epic 3 when ready**
   - Start creating Story 3.1 with SM agent's `create-story`
   - Epic will be marked as `in-progress` automatically when first story is created
   - Ensure all critical path items are done first

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "2.5 days of prep work is reasonable, especially compared to the 3 days we did before Epic 2."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I'll communicate the timeline to stakeholders. They'll understand if we frame it as 'ensuring Epic 3 success.'"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Before we wrap, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the team."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Epic 2 delivered 3 complete stories and 1 nearly-complete story (97%) with 431 tests passing. We integrated two AWS services (Textract and Rekognition). We deployed to staging in af-south-1. We built sophisticated risk scoring algorithms. That's real work by real people."

**Charlie (Senior Dev):** "Hear, hear."

**Alice (Product Owner):** "I'm proud of what we shipped."

**Dana (QA Engineer):** "And I'm excited about Epic 3 - especially now that we're prepared for it."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Edmond, any final thoughts before we close?"

**Edmond (Project Lead):** "I'm impressed with the technical sophistication of Epic 2. The weighted scoring, privacy-preserving duplicate detection, and AWS service integrations are production-quality work. The 2.5-day prep sprint is the right call - let's finish strong."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Thank you for that, Edmond."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "Alright team - great work today. We learned a lot from Epic 2. Let's use these insights to make Epic 3 even better."

**Bob (Scrum Master):** "See you all when prep work is done. Meeting adjourned!"

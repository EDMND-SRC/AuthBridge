# Observations:

I keep seeing "@ballerine/verification-service" in some of the commands you run. Ballerine is the name of the original non-functional app and initial scaffolding with no actual backend. We've now built AuthBridge in its place - wholly proprietary. I need to know what this is exactly "@ballerine/verification-service" and rename it/refactor it accordingly. Don't edit anything yet, I want your assessment first.

# Review:

I want you to compare DynamoDB MCP vs DynamoDB Local via Java (Homebrew). Use web search for research.

Research comprehensively and assess the following MCPs for this project:

- awslabs.aws-serverless-mcp

- awslabs.dynamodb-mcp-server

- aws-knowledge-mcp-server

# Workflow commands:

/ @sm.md run *create-story

/ @dev.md run *dev-story workflow for Story 4.2 #4-2-create...

/ @dev.md run *code-review workflow for Story 4.2 #4-2-create...

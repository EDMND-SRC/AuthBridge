# Observations:

I keep seeing "@ballerine/verification-service" in some of the commands you run. Ballerine is the name of the original non-functional app and initial scaffolding with no actual backend. We've now built AuthBridge in its place - wholly proprietary. I need to know what this is exactly "@ballerine/verification-service" and rename it/refactor it accordingly. Don't edit anything yet, I want your assessment first.

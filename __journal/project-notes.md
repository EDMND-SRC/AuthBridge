Create a new folder/repo called BridgeArc
This folder is meant to be the digital personification of the BridgeArc company.
BridgeArc will eventually own AuthBridge, Squad360, and TaxSync.
These three apps are currently in development in my personal name.
I plan to create 3 separate businesses for each of them - with BridgeArc as the holding and operational company.
I need to apply for copyright, IP, BOBS, etc
